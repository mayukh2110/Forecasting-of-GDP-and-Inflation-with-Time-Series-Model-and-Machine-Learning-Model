**Forecasting GDP and Inflation Using Time Series and Machine Learning Models**


This project focuses on time series forecasting of GDP and inflation rates across four major economies: the U.S., China, Japan, and the U.K., using ARIMA, SARIMA, and Random Forest models. The study provides a comparative analysis of each model’s performance, highlighting the strengths and limitations of traditional time series models against machine learning approaches.

**Project Overview**
Economic forecasting is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and investors to make informed decisions. This dissertation addresses a gap in economic forecasting literature by directly comparing three popular forecasting methods—ARIMA, SARIMA, and Random Forest—in the context of GDP and inflation prediction. Using data from the World Bank, the project investigates each model's ability to capture trends, seasonal patterns, and economic volatility.

**Key Features**
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Historical GDP and inflation data sourced from the World Bank for four economies.
Applied differencing and decomposition techniques to ensure stationarity and separate trend, seasonal, and residual components.
2. Model Implementation
ARIMA and SARIMA models were used to account for time-based dependencies and seasonality.
Random Forest model was applied to explore non-linear relationships and complex economic patterns.
3. Model Evaluation
Forecast accuracy evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Comparative analysis across economic contexts to understand model performance under different conditions.
4. Results and Analysis
Insights into each model's strengths, including ARIMA’s accuracy for short-term forecasts, SARIMA’s effectiveness for seasonal data, and Random Forest’s robustness in non-linear contexts.
Tailored recommendations for using each model based on economic conditions and data characteristics.

**Tools and Technologies**
Python: Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and model implementation.
Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn: Data handling, statistical computations, and machine learning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualizations of data trends, model predictions, and residual diagnostics.

**Conclusion**
The findings provide actionable insights for selecting forecasting models tailored to different economic environments, enhancing decision-making for policymakers and financial analysts. This project contributes to the literature on economic forecasting by offering a rigorous comparative framework for time series and machine learning methods.
